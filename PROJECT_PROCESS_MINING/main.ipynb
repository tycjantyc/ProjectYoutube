      "[00:33.000 --> 00:38.000]  You are sleeping a complete cycle because it is a 90-minute cycle.\n",
      "[00:38.000 --> 00:42.000]  You have to complete the cycle as a whole.\n",
      "[00:42.000 --> 00:45.000]  So, this is not a question, how much you should sleep?\n",
      "[00:45.000 --> 00:47.000]  How much proper time you should sleep?\n",

      "[00:16.280 --> 00:19.440]  and I came back and folks had sleep and whatnot.\n",
      "[00:19.440 --> 00:21.800]  And I'm like, one day I walked in the house\n",

      "[00:32.920 --> 00:35.840]  Sat everybody down one day and I was like, look,\n",

      "[00:37.080 --> 00:40.520]  Like, I'm headed on this path to be successful,\n",

      "[00:52.000 --> 00:53.720]  where there's people that want to be\n",
      "[00:53.720 --> 00:55.400]  on the same path that I'm on.\n",
      "[00:00.000 --> 00:02.800]  The first thing is to not do the first thing before sleeping.\n",
      "[00:02.800 --> 00:05.000]  First of all, eat very heavy food.\n",
      "[00:05.000 --> 00:08.200]  Eat dinner at least 3-4 hours before sleeping.\n",
      "[00:08.200 --> 00:12.600]  Nekotin and caffeine, that is, coffee, tea, chocolates.\n",
      "[00:12.600 --> 00:19.800]  This is not the first thing to take at least 3 hours because you are not good at caffeine.\n",
      "[00:19.800 --> 00:23.400]  If it is most important, today we will do the screen time.\n",
      "[00:23.400 --> 00:26.600]  The blue light is mislead the brain.\n",
      "[00:26.600 --> 00:32.400]  As it is still day, at least 1 hour before sleeping, you have to be completely different from the hot screen.\n",
      "[00:32.400 --> 00:39.000]  Then the second thing that is better than the second thing is that the time of sleeping should be fixed.\n",
      "[00:00.000 --> 00:02.520]  To fall asleep, I put on a podcast.\n",
      "[00:02.520 --> 00:04.880]  What kind of podcast do you listen to go to sleep?\n",
      "[00:04.880 --> 00:06.600]  It's so funny, because everyone is like,\n",
      "[00:06.600 --> 00:09.080]  wait, what? They're the most rogue podcast.\n",
      "[00:09.080 --> 00:11.080]  Okay, so one of them is Morning Brew Daily,\n",
      "[00:11.080 --> 00:12.840]  which is a business podcast.\n",
      "[00:12.840 --> 00:15.640]  Another one is pivot with Scott Galloway and Cara Swaycher.\n",
      "[00:15.640 --> 00:17.040]  So these are like intense podcasts\n",
      "[00:17.040 --> 00:18.880]  that are talking about current events like politics.\n",
      "[00:18.880 --> 00:20.760]  And then also I love fluently forward,\n",
      "[00:20.760 --> 00:22.640]  which is like a pop culture podcast\n",
      "[00:22.640 --> 00:25.160]  and then finally beyond the blinds is another one.\n",
      "[00:25.160 --> 00:27.800]  That is such a crazy rotation for nighttime podcasts.\n",
      "[00:27.800 --> 00:28.640]  I know.\n",
      "[00:00.000 --> 00:02.700]  What can be less than a human being?\n",
      "[00:02.700 --> 00:06.260]  So there are many diseases of regularly which are very dangerous for the sleep.\n",
      "[00:06.260 --> 00:07.920]  Most dangerous diseases are cancer.\n",
      "[00:07.920 --> 00:13.400]  This is shown that less people get cancer incidents, not only in the night,\n",
      "[00:13.400 --> 00:14.800]  but also in the spread.\n",
      "[00:14.800 --> 00:18.500]  So a big, interesting experiment was done in the RATS.\n",
      "[00:18.500 --> 00:20.420]  So there were two groups of rats.\n",
      "[00:20.420 --> 00:23.100]  One was injected with a tumor of cancer.\n",
      "[00:23.100 --> 00:24.940]  One group of rats is normal.\n",
      "[00:24.940 --> 00:28.300]  And the other group of rats was not able to sleep or avoid.\n",
      "[00:28.300 --> 00:30.100]  The rats were not able to sleep.\n",
      "[00:30.100 --> 00:33.000]  They had more cancer than 200 times.\n",
      "[00:33.000 --> 00:34.000]  200 times.\n",
      "[00:34.000 --> 00:36.100]  They were not able to sleep only for 200 times.\n",
      "[00:00.000 --> 00:05.120]  Breast neurotransmitters in the brain are much less active during the REM stage of sleep,\n",
      "[00:05.120 --> 00:09.840]  even during dreams of traumatic experiences, leading some researchers to theorize that one\n",
      "[00:09.840 --> 00:14.960]  purpose of dreaming is to take the edge-off painful experiences to allow for psychological\n",
      "[00:14.960 --> 00:16.200]  healing.\n",
      "[00:16.200 --> 00:20.320]  Reviewing traumatic events in your dreams with less mental stress may grant you a clearer\n",
      "[00:20.320 --> 00:25.880]  perspective and an enhanced ability to process them in psychologically healthy ways.\n",
      "[00:25.880 --> 00:31.040]  People with certain mood disorders and PTSD often have difficulty sleeping, leading some\n",
      "[00:31.040 --> 00:35.840]  scientists to believe that lack of dreaming may be a contributing factor to their illnesses.\n",
      "[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  So, the Melatonin that is released in the body is from the pineal gland.\n",
      "[00:05.000 --> 00:08.000]  When you look at the blue light, it doesn't exist.\n",
      "[00:08.000 --> 00:11.000]  So, because of the Melatonin, you feel the need.\n",
      "[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  The Melatonin is triggered.\n",
      "[00:13.000 --> 00:15.000]  So, you think that it is a signal.\n",
      "[00:15.000 --> 00:17.000]  So, when you look at the blue light,\n",
      "[00:17.000 --> 00:22.000]  the biological clock in our face is that\n",
      "[00:22.000 --> 00:26.000]  the pineal gland does not signal and when it does not signal\n",
      "[00:26.000 --> 00:30.000]  and the Melatonin is not released, the blue light triggers the brain.\n",
      "[00:00.000 --> 00:12.520]  So insufficient sleep is a powerful predictor of mental and physical health problems.\n",
      "[00:12.520 --> 00:18.600]  In particular, deep sleep is necessary for encoding of the memories of our day.\n",
      "[00:18.600 --> 00:21.200]  So it's very important in learning.\n",
      "[00:21.200 --> 00:27.680]  And sleep deprivation has a powerful negative effect on kids' ability to achieve academically.\n",
      "[00:27.680 --> 00:36.800]  Not only that, sleep deprivation is a powerful predictor of depression, of anxiety, as well as obesity.\n",
      "[00:36.800 --> 00:43.600]  So it's not a mystery why in the setting of kids getting less sleep than they ever have before.\n",
      "[00:43.600 --> 00:52.480]  Teenagers in particular, we're seeing these terrible increases in depression, anxiety, self-harmoned suicideality.\n",
      "[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  Performance is better.\n",
      "[00:02.000 --> 00:04.000]  The less they are, the less they are.\n",
      "[00:04.000 --> 00:07.000]  This student has studied that the entire 800 years\n",
      "[00:07.000 --> 00:09.000]  their exam performance is better.\n",
      "[00:09.000 --> 00:12.000]  The less they are, the more their exam performance is less.\n",
      "[00:12.000 --> 00:15.000]  Now, look what is important.\n",
      "[00:15.000 --> 00:18.000]  People ask how much time they should sleep.\n",
      "[00:18.000 --> 00:19.000]  Okay?\n",
      "[00:19.000 --> 00:21.000]  How much time is more important than sleep?\n",
      "[00:21.000 --> 00:24.000]  You are so complete cycle-sleeping\n",
      "[00:24.000 --> 00:26.000]  because it is a 90-minute cycle.\n",
      "[00:26.000 --> 00:27.000]  Okay?\n",
      "[00:27.000 --> 00:30.000]  You are completely complete cycle-sleeping.\n",
      "[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  So, this is not a question.\n",
      "[00:32.000 --> 00:33.000]  You are so complete.\n",
      "[00:33.000 --> 00:35.000]  You are so complete.\n",
      "[00:35.000 --> 00:36.000]  I will give you an example.\n",
      "[00:36.000 --> 00:38.000]  Suppose you have a good sleep-sleeping.\n",
      "[00:38.000 --> 00:41.000]  Or, you have a good sleep-sleeping\n",
      "[00:41.000 --> 00:43.000]  and a short sleep.\n",
      "[00:43.000 --> 00:44.000]  It is a short sleep.\n",
      "[00:44.000 --> 00:45.000]  It is not a short sleep.\n",
      "[00:45.000 --> 00:48.000]  So, you are in a relationship.\n",
      "[00:48.000 --> 00:51.000]  So, the most important thing is sleep.\n",
      "[00:00.000 --> 00:03.000]  Ask how long it should be.\n",
      "[00:03.000 --> 00:06.000]  How much time is more important than the time?\n",
      "[00:06.000 --> 00:09.000]  How much is the complete cycle?\n",
      "[00:09.000 --> 00:11.000]  Because it is a 90 minute cycle.\n",

      "[00:14.000 --> 00:18.000]  The biggest culprit of the thought is the two or three times.\n",
      "[00:18.000 --> 00:19.000]  It is an alarm clock.\n",
      "[00:19.000 --> 00:22.000]  Because the alarm clock is also given to you.\n",
      "[00:22.000 --> 00:24.000]  Especially when you take it in the R&M steep.\n",
      "[00:24.000 --> 00:26.000]  When you take it from the alarm clock,\n",
      "[00:26.000 --> 00:28.000]  then the whole body becomes strange.\n",
      "[00:28.000 --> 00:29.000]  It is a little hot.\n",
      "[00:29.000 --> 00:31.000]  Your blood pressure gets high.\n",
      "[00:31.000 --> 00:32.000]  Your heart is beating.\n",
      "[00:32.000 --> 00:34.000]  It is a little weird.\n",
      "[00:34.000 --> 00:40.000]  The best thing about the thought is that you should ask yourself.\n",
      "[00:40.000 --> 00:43.000]  Because when a cycle of your body is complete,\n",
      "[00:43.000 --> 00:45.000]  then your body gets raised.\n",
      "[00:00.000 --> 00:03.240]  caffeine blocks what we call a dentisid.\n",
      "[00:03.240 --> 00:07.320]  A dentisid is a hormone that builds up in the brain\n",
      "[00:07.320 --> 00:09.200]  that actually is sleep promoting.\n",
      "[00:09.200 --> 00:11.800]  Over the course of the day, the longer you're weak,\n",
      "[00:11.800 --> 00:13.740]  the more dentisid that's built up\n",
      "[00:13.740 --> 00:15.040]  and that makes you sleepier.\n",
      "[00:15.040 --> 00:19.080]  So if you're drinking caffeine into the afternoon,\n",
      "[00:19.080 --> 00:21.080]  you're definitely gonna disrupt that process.\n",
      "[00:00.000 --> 00:03.600]  Jena, since you've tried with this whole story, I've gone into sleep paralysis.\n",
      "[00:03.600 --> 00:06.200]  How would you have explained that then?\n",
      "[00:06.200 --> 00:07.200]  Well, sleep paralysis.\n",
      "[00:07.200 --> 00:09.800]  Yeah, for some people, don't know what it means.\n",
      "[00:09.800 --> 00:12.200]  I don't know, I don't even know what it is, but...\n",
      "[00:12.200 --> 00:15.800]  How is it that I've just been about long explaining it and you still don't know what it is?\n",
      "[00:15.800 --> 00:18.800]  It seems like an episode of Inception or something.\n",
      "[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  So, in this case, people naturally sleep.\n",
      "[00:04.000 --> 00:08.000]  But the test of this, if your deck is too effective,\n",
      "[00:08.000 --> 00:10.000]  then these people naturally sleep.\n",
      "[00:10.000 --> 00:12.000]  That means, they are not able to sleep.\n",
      "[00:12.000 --> 00:14.000]  But they are able to sleep at 4-5 minutes.\n",
      "[00:14.000 --> 00:18.000]  So, there is nothing wrong with that.\n",
      "[00:18.000 --> 00:24.000]  It is a natural, but again, important, natural sleeping, natural wake-up.\n",
      "[00:24.000 --> 00:28.000]  You sleep on your bed like you go to bed and you sleep on your bed.\n",
      "[00:28.000 --> 00:30.000]  That is healthy sleeping.\n",
      "[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  This is very hardy cleaning.\n",

      "[00:02.400 --> 00:03.600]  there's lots of things you can do.\n",

      "[00:06.440 --> 00:07.880]  It's so fascinating, right?\n",
      "[00:07.880 --> 00:09.560]  Again, because these things haven't been measured\n",
      "[00:09.560 --> 00:11.680]  since we were young, and because we don't know\n",
      "[00:11.680 --> 00:13.640]  what to look out for, you could be sitting there\n",
      "[00:13.640 --> 00:16.040]  for months or years going,\n",
      "[00:16.040 --> 00:17.240]  why do I wake up feeling like this?\n",
      "[00:17.240 --> 00:19.280]  Maybe I'm anxious, maybe I'm stressed,\n",
      "[00:19.280 --> 00:20.760]  and that could be a part of it,\n",
      "[00:20.760 --> 00:22.440]  but there's something else going on as well.\n",
      "[00:22.440 --> 00:24.800]  Yeah, I can tell you how many people\n",
      "[00:24.800 --> 00:27.960]  that I simply asked the few questions I just asked you,\n",
      "[00:27.960 --> 00:28.960]  and they're like, yeah, I have that.\n",
      "[00:28.960 --> 00:29.800]  Yeah, I have that.\n",
      "[00:29.800 --> 00:32.160]  It's like a revelation, and they're 55 years old,\n",
      "[00:32.160 --> 00:34.960]  and they have sleep apnea, they've had it for 25 years.\n",
      "[00:34.960 --> 00:37.600]  So it's really sad how underdiagnosed it is,\n",
      "[00:37.600 --> 00:39.640]  and how incredibly treatable it is,\n",
      "[00:39.640 --> 00:42.080]  and I could change the trajectory of your life, you know,\n",
      "[00:42.080 --> 00:44.760]  because once you treat sleep apnea,\n",
      "[00:44.760 --> 00:47.680]  your metabolism actually gets under control,\n",
      "[00:47.680 --> 00:49.400]  and you start losing weight,\n",
      "[00:49.400 --> 00:51.480]  you start having less glucose spikes,\n",
      "[00:51.480 --> 00:55.480]  you start eating better, you feel less brain fog,\n",

      "[00:00.000 --> 00:04.000]  The main goal is to increase the amount of blood in two parts.\n",
      "[00:04.000 --> 00:08.000]  The second part is that our eyes are healed.\n",
      "[00:08.000 --> 00:13.000]  This is how the medically called REM sleep rapid eye movement.\n",
      "[00:13.000 --> 00:17.000]  And the first part is that our eyes are not healed.\n",
      "[00:17.000 --> 00:20.000]  If you are sleeping for 8 hours then in the first 4 hours...\n",
      "[00:20.000 --> 00:22.000]  I mean in the first 4 hours it is 80%\n",
      "[00:22.000 --> 00:23.000]  I will explain it in a moment.\n",
      "[00:23.000 --> 00:26.000]  So, let's take a look at the sleep.\n",
      "[00:26.000 --> 00:29.000]  The first non-epid eye movement that is 80%\n",
      "[00:29.000 --> 00:31.000]  is not healed in that.\n",
      "[00:31.000 --> 00:33.000]  And the last 20 is healed in that.\n",
      "[00:33.000 --> 00:35.000]  And the last one is not healed in that.\n",
      "[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  The most dangerous thing is cancer.\n",
      "[00:02.000 --> 00:04.000]  So, as I have seen,\n",
      "[00:04.000 --> 00:06.000]  the fewer people who are sleeping,\n",
      "[00:06.000 --> 00:08.000]  the more the incidence of cancer is not much,\n",
      "[00:08.000 --> 00:10.000]  and the spread is also much.\n",
      "[00:10.000 --> 00:12.000]  The experiment was done in RATS\n",
      "[00:12.000 --> 00:14.000]  so, we had taken two groups of rats\n",
      "[00:14.000 --> 00:16.000]  and injected them in the tumor.\n",
      "[00:16.000 --> 00:18.000]  One group of rats was normal,\n",

      "[00:00.000 --> 00:08.080]  I think for me, one of the very valuable advice that I got done was that, you know, feeling\n",
      "[00:08.080 --> 00:12.400]  down or feeling a little bit negative is actually part of, you know, your whole life.\n",
      "[00:12.400 --> 00:16.480]  You know, you don't go high all the time. It's like, high and low, high and low, right?\n",

      "[00:26.720 --> 00:27.720]  that thing.\n",
      "[00:28.680 --> 00:34.760]  It's a simple thing that people say don't stress. But I think it's the second class after that\n",
      "[00:34.760 --> 00:41.560]  that is invisible that people don't often appreciate. It's like, it's not about not stressing\n",
      "[00:41.560 --> 00:47.160]  and stopping the worry, but it's about taking active action.\n",
      "[00:00.000 --> 00:01.840]  I don't think that's ing\n",

      "[00:13.320 --> 00:15.800]  this is the same as when we are sleeping.\n",
      "[00:15.800 --> 00:17.600]  This is the same pattern.\n",
      "[00:17.600 --> 00:19.600]  That's why we are on highway accidents.\n",
      "[00:19.600 --> 00:24.120]  If you sleep for 6-8 hours,\n",
      "[00:24.120 --> 00:26.200]  then that's the chances of accident.\n",
      "[00:00.000 --> 00:03.840]  I was talking about something that actually came across this story of a Vietnamese man\n",
      "[00:03.840 --> 00:08.320]  who clean has a slap in 40 years. Is that possible? Myth of fact.\n",
      "[00:08.320 --> 00:14.240]  I think that is probably a myth. I don't think it's possible for anyone to survive for that long\n",
      "[00:14.240 --> 00:19.680]  without sleep. This man may be suffering from sleep-wake misperception and that is when\n",
      "[00:20.720 --> 00:25.200]  they are actually sleeping but they don't feel like they have slept at all.\n",
      "[00:25.200 --> 00:27.520]  So now I have a question for you as well.\n",
      "[00:27.520 --> 00:32.800]  Daylight exposure especially to their eyes is important for our sleep cycle.\n",
      "[00:33.280 --> 00:42.480]  Myth of fact. That is fact. So daylight exposure actually is important because it stimulates\n",
      "[00:42.480 --> 00:49.360]  specialised receptors in our eyes to help keep our body clock accurate so that we know when it's\n",
      "[00:49.360 --> 00:53.840]  daytime and when it's night time and when night time comes our body will release\n",
      "[00:53.840 --> 00:58.480]  my little need to help make us fall asleep naturally.\n",
      "[00:00.000 --> 00:02.600]  So I said, first of all, non-arium sleep and rm sleep.\n",

      "[00:08.800 --> 00:12.200]  But when it comes to sleep, when the rm sleep comes,\n",
      "[00:12.200 --> 00:13.800]  then the logical brain is shut.\n",
      "[00:13.800 --> 00:16.200]  You go in a scan, you have to do the logical brain, it is not working at all.\n",
      "[00:16.200 --> 00:17.200]  Do you think logical brain is shut?\n",
      "[00:17.200 --> 00:21.200]  Logical brain, the brain that is designed, decides the exact decision,\n",
      "[00:21.200 --> 00:23.000]  whether to do it or not, to decide who to do it,\n",
      "[00:23.000 --> 00:26.000]  who to do it, what to do, what to do, this is an intelligent activity.\n",
      "[00:26.000 --> 00:27.000]  The brain is in the brain.\n",
      "[00:27.000 --> 00:29.600]  It is shut in the time of dreams, it is shut.\n",
      "[00:29.600 --> 00:31.600]  And what is the emotional brain?\n",
      "[00:31.600 --> 00:35.600]  So the emotional brain, our brain, this is the part of the outside.\n",
      "[00:35.600 --> 00:38.600]  In our middle and center, there is an emotional brain system.\n",
      "[00:38.600 --> 00:40.600]  There are two or three parts, which are called a amygdala,\n",
      "[00:40.600 --> 00:43.200]  which is the fear of the negative emotions.\n",
      "[00:43.200 --> 00:45.200]  And an Olympic system is called an area.\n",
      "[00:45.200 --> 00:49.200]  So we have seen that in the dreams, the negative emotions become more positive,\n",
      "[00:49.200 --> 00:50.200]  the positive emotions become less.\n",
      "[00:00.000 --> 00:03.280]  These are very common parents and children.\n",

      "[00:24.880 --> 00:28.160]  She should sleep whenever she is comfortable.\n",
      "[00:28.160 --> 00:33.160]  My important message to my daughter is if you sleep at 1, please don't wake up before 9.\n",

      "[00:02.540 --> 00:06.140]  So there are many diseases regularly which are very dangerous for the sleep.\n",

      "[00:07.780 --> 00:14.700]  This is shown that less people get cancer incidents, not only more than that, but spread.\n",
      "[00:14.700 --> 00:18.460]  So a big, interesting experiment was done in rats.\n",
      "[00:18.460 --> 00:20.220]  So there were two groups of rats.\n",

      "[00:24.820 --> 00:28.180]  And the other group of rats was not able to avoid sleeping.\n",
      "[00:28.340 --> 00:29.940]  The rats were not sleeping.\n",
      "[00:29.940 --> 00:32.940]  They had more cancer than 200 times.\n",

      "[00:33.860 --> 00:36.220]  They were only sleeping because of the sleep.\n",

      "[00:07.760 --> 00:14.640]  This is what is seen that weak people have a lot of cancer incidents, not only in the night, but also in the spread.\n",
      "[00:14.640 --> 00:18.440]  So a big, interesting experiment was done in the rats.\n",

      "[00:26.720 --> 00:36.320]  And so you're going to have to give that person a lot more, right? And then God forbid they actually listen and we start cleaning their gut up and and their thyroid starts working.\n",
      "[00:36.320 --> 00:43.840]  And they need less hormone. If you don't realize that as a provider and you're given in the same dose and they start having bad side effects, you don't realize to pull it back.\n",
      "[00:43.840 --> 00:48.080]  Then the patient's like, well, I'm not taking these hormones, you know, so it's there's a lot of moving parts.\n",

      "[00:01.800 --> 00:03.480]  You have to know exactly when you're going to sleep.\n",
      "[00:03.480 --> 00:05.800]  So if you know you're going to sleep at 10 o'clock,\n",
